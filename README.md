What you'll need:
1. Text Editor for editing code - anything will do, I've used atom and VSCode before

2. Node - You'll need to install node, which allows you to install ReactNative and Expo.
    I did some quick googling and gave this link a cursory glance, seems like it might help:

3. ReactNative - this is a framework (basically a fancy language) we'll be using to develop.
      Link: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
      *Follow the Expo CLI instructions, and not the ReactNative CLI instructions
      *Expo CLI is just a different way of 'running' the language vs. using ReactNative CLI for the same purpose*

4. Download Expo app on your phone - This lets you simulate the app on your phone, allowing you to see what we've built so far
